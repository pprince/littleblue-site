=================

I have a website (one is at http://littlebluetech.com/), and this is the
collection of source code whence it comes.

The static-ness is very handy in many instances, and the tool I use for that
(Jekyll) is endorsed by GitHub.com for use with GitHub Pages.

This project may expand to include a reference back-end implementation.


BlueBox
=======

BlueBox is my collection of SASS snippets, mixins, odds, and ends.  This stuff
is being shared between several front-end projects.
