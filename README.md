pprince/littleblue-site
=======================

I have a website at http://littlebluetech.com/ and this is its Git repository.

This project serves primarily as a demonstration, of a roll-your-own, modern,
static, site.  Here I glue together helpful components, rather than use
something more pre-baked like Twitter's Bootstrap.


Features
--------

  * New Compass (1.0.0, currently alpha)

  * New SASS (3.3.0, currently release-cantidate)

  * New Susy (2.0.0, currently beta)

  * Integrated Package Management

    It's very simple for any developer to quickly replicate a self-contained environment with all the build dependencies baked in; this should get a team up-and-running quickly.

    * python-pip

    * ruby-gem

    * node-npm

    * bower is available for front-end assets

  * Grunt

    * build
