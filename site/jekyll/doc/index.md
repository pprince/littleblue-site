Major Components
================


Compass/Sass and Susy
---------------------

  - **Compass-SASS**
  
    *1.0.0 Alpha Pre-Release*

    "… an open-source *CSS Authoring Framework*."

    [Compass 1.0 Documentation](http://beta.compass-style.org/) --- this is a **_must-read!_**

    … it's more capable than LESS!

    - **Susy 2** *Stable*

      - Intuitive Syntax for Responsive Grids/Spans.

  - **Jekyll** *1.5.0 Stable*

    - "Blog-aware" static site generator.

    - Liquid template language is very similar to Django's.


Package Management
------------------

It's very simple for any developer to quickly replicate a self-contained
environment with all the build dependencies baked in; this should get a
team up-and-running quickly.

  - ### python ###

    - **pip**

    - virtualenvwrapper is strongly recommended, along with my
    *virtualenvwrapper.npm* extension and my fork of the *virtualenvwrapper.gem* extension (more below.)

  - ### ruby ###

    - **gem**

    - virtual/isolated environment provided by:
    
      - **bundler** + *virtualenvwrapper.gem* helper.

  - ### node ###

    - **npm**

    - virtual/isolated environment provided by:
    
      - npm solves this problem itself,  plus *virtualenvwrapper.npm* helper.

  - ### Front-End Assets ###

    - **bower** for quickly downloading and versioning JavaScript, SASS/CSS/etc. libraries.


Build Tools and Development Workflow
------------------------------------

  - **Grunt**

    - install

    - build

    - watch

      - livereload


Installation
------------

The following instructions and information should assist you in quickly
configuring a self-contained replica of my development environment.  Advanced
users may feel free to improvise.


### System Prerequisites ###

The following items must be installed before continuing.  I typically install
them system-wide, from distribution packages.

You can install even these dependencies into your homedir or another directory;
such configurations are left as an exercise.

- nodejs and npm
  - and npm
- python, 2.7
  - and pip
- ruby, 1.9.3
  - and gem
- pandoc

On Unix/Linux, you will need to be root to install the items above, system-wide.

You should not need to make use of the root user (or "su", or "sudo") beyond
this point; if you get permission-denied errors, double-check that you've
completed the previous steps correctly.

### Install Dev Tools to Home Directory ###

Distribution-provided versions of virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper are usually
out-of-date, so I generally pip-install the current version to my home
directory:

```
pip install --user virtualenv
pip install --user virtualenvwrapper
```

Also, I have managed to avoid RVM/rbenv and nvm, by having the Python-centric
virtualenvwrapper also handle my ruby and node global environments.  If you
want to do the same, you need only install my npm and gem plugins for
virtualwrapper:

```
pip install --user git+https://github.com/pprince/virtualenvwrapper.gem.git@ppdevel#egg=virtualenvwrapper.gem
pip install --user git+https://github.com/pprince/virtualenvwrapper.npm.git@ppdevel#egg=virtualenvwrapper.npm
```

Once you have done this, you can create a virtualenvwrapper project for your
working copy of the site:

```
mkproject littleblue-site
```

And, assuming you're using my extensions from above, you will want to activate
them for this project:

```
cdvirtualenv
touch .gem
touch .npm
deactivate
workon littleblue-site
```

### Verify Configuration ###

Before proceeding, it is imporant that you verify that the previous steps were
performed correctly.  Otherwise, your installations may not go where you
expect.  (The results can be confusing to sort out.)

Ensure that you have activated the project/environment with the `workon`
command.  I recommend you customize your shell prompt to keep you informed of
your current environment and git branch.

Then, use the `env` to ensure that GEM_HOME and NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX have been set
(and set to the same value) before continuing.


### Clone Your Repository ###

Substitute in the correct git URL for your fork of this repository.

Take note of the dot ('.') character after the URL below:

```
git clone git@github.com:pprince/littleblue-site.git .
```


### Install Dev Tools and Dependencies to the Virtualenv ###

We install the current version of bundler to our virtual environment root, and
then use it to install all of our Ruby development dependencies:

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Although grunt-cli is really intended to be installed only once per system or
per user (such as, e.g., into your home directory like we installed
virtualenv), my virtualenvwrapper plugins assume you want an even greater
degree of independence and separation between environments.  So, for npm, you
have *both* a global and a local/project scope for each virtualenvwrapper
environment, and this installation will go into the virtual environment root:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Not actually currently necessary, but expected to be at some point:

```
pip install -r < requirements-dev.txt
```

### Install Per-Project/Local Dev Dependencies ###

This will populate the `./node_modules/` folder, installing the Grunt taskrunner et al.:

```
npm install
```

### Front-End Assets ###

Although I am currently managing front-end assets manually, Bower has been
integrated into the install/build process in case you would like to use it:

```
grunt install   # -->  Runs `bower install`.
```


Known Issues
============

  1. The build is slower than perhaps it could be.  It's not too bad.  I'm just
  going to deal with it.

  2. When you run `grunt`, or `grunt run`, etc., to start the watching and
  serving process, you're going to have to wait around for Jekyll to go through
  two whole builds.  Other than the wasted time at start-up, it works really
  well.
